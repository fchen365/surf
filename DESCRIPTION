Description: 
    Advances in high-throughput profiling of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have 
    resulted in CLIP-seq datasets coupled with transcriptome profiling by 
    RNA-seq. However, analysis methods that integrate both types of data are 
    lacking. We describe SURF, Statistical Utility for RBP Functions, for 
    integrative analysis of large collections of CLIP-seq and RNA-seq data to 
    identify alternative splicing (AS), alternative transcription 
    initiation (ATI), and alternative polyadenylation (APA) events regulated by 
    individual RBPs and elucidate protein-RNA interactions governing these 
    events.
